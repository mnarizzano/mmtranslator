## 1. Introduction

<a name="sp1.1"></a>
This document is a simple example of a User Requirements Documents that is used as running example in the Software Engineering class at University of Genoa, course number 80154. It describes the functionality of a simple software that translate a Mealy machine from a format to another format.

### 1.1 Document Scope

<a name="sp1.2"></a>
This document is provided to the students of the SE-80154 course as an example of User Requirements documents. It shows how requirements can be written and which are the main errors in writing specifications. It may contains errors that are presents for didactical reasons.

## 2. System Description
<a name="sp2.15"></a>
[Mealy Machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mealy_machine) are a type of automata that are uesd to model some kind of Embedded Systems. They can be described as a finite-state machine whose output values are determined both by its current state and the current inputs. In figure can be found a visual example of a Mealy machine.
