### First Meeting Notes

Date: 21/03/2023

Participants: Head of MNcomp(Head), a MM designer(Designer), a chip loader(Loader)

Notes:

**What is the main problem?** - **Head**:The main problems is that The MNcomp employees do not know the NewChip Design Tools and the Head of MNcomp does not think is a good idea to spend a lot of money to teach the NewChip Design tool to its employees. 

**Why not to hire new Employees that already have the knowledge?**. - **Head**: We can not fire all the MNcomp Employees since we still have an important part of business using old chips. On the other hand we can not afford to have double people, one with the knowledge of the OldChip Design Tools and one with the knowledge on the NewChip Design Tool. The best would be to teach to the MNcomp Empployees the new tool. However this could have some drawbacks: first we have a lot of MM already designed with Oldchip Designer tool that in principle can be reused on the new chips but they must be re-drawed using NewChip Designer Tools, so waste of Time, and second what if tomorrow we want to expand our business with a new chip with different output format? should we learn anohter tool? It is not affordable. 

**What is the Kiss2 format?** **Loader** : is a new test file format describing a MM. **is there anny difference between Mealy Machines written in dot format from the ones written in Kiss2 format?** From a semantic point of view there are not differences between the same MM written in dot format and Kiss2 format. They differ only from the syntax point of view. A node is a node in both formats, so are also transitions, signals and all the other part of the MM machine.  

**MM has requirements for the Design?** **Designer** Of course when we start to design a MM we have some requirements similar to the requirements used in Requirements Engineering. However since we are describing some embedded systems behaviours we use a formal language to describe the MM funcionality. Have a look at this [reference](first-references.pdf).
